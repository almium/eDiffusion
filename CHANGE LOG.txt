Version 2.0.0

++ Implemented quenching at interface for transistor-like experiment to measure the exciton quenching 
  radius of induced charges at the dielectric-semiconductor interface

+ new PrepocessorOptions.h. User can switch off the periodic boundary conditions along z-axis.
+ 2 new experiment_types: e110, e120 
+ quenchers are placed at z=0 on a square lattice
+ a couple of performance improvement are implemented in CloassExciton.hop3() 
  

Version 1.1.5

* Fixed bug for very long PL decays

Version 1.1.4

- Implement 3-exponential decay in the pristine film

Version 1.1.2

- Experiment type 21: For thermal relaxation. Vary exciton temperature to get specific
  quenching efficiency

- Implement linear extrapolation when searching for TRel_M in experiment type 21. This enhancement 
  improves simulation efficiency.

Version 1.1.1

- upgrage thermal relaxation with Gaussian distribution of initial hopsizes


Version 1.1.0

- automate selection of dT. Now user should not care aobut 
  hopsize * sqrt(dT) < qRadius
- introduce thermal relaxation using two parameters
  TRel_hopsize_hot and TRel_time


Version 1.0.1

- implement possiblitiy to vary hopsize with constant tau and 
  constant background density. Experiment_type = 50
- write <dL^2> to output files in to othere epexriment types as well

Version 1.0.1

- implement possiblitiy to vary tau. Experiment_type = 40


Version 1.0

- implement action sphere to mimich Forster energy trasnfer to fullerenes
- experiment type 20: now it is possible also to use quencher concentration here
- separated classes from medium.cpp. New files are ClassBool3D.cpp, 
  ClassMedium.cpp, ClassQuencher.cpp. medium.cpp can be deleted

=============
Version 0.9.2.2

- Also caluclae <dL> and <dx>

Version 0.9.2.1

- FIX: Only in version 0.9.2 there was a bug in function hop2(). 
  There was "x+=dz" instead of "z+=dz"

Version 0.9.2

- FIX:  Ld, which is shown after each generation was not calculated right.
  now it is sqrt (<dL^2>). This value is directly related to exciton diffusion length Ld=sqrt(d*tau*D).

==============
Version 0.9.1.1

- fixed bug of 4/3 -> 4.0/3.0

Version 0.9.1

- implement possibitiy to set a range of quencher concentration instead of 
  the volume fraction
- write also quencher concentration in cm-3 to the Radiative vs Volume fraction file
- in experiments where the range is changed, fix the handling of array from 
  15 rows to 50 rows. 

==============
Version 0.9

- implement possibitity to vary the quencher size in order to reach the 
  specific quenching efficiency using the specific hopsize

==============
Version 0.8

- implement offset for volume fraction when running in vFrac variation mode



==============
Version 0.7

- this version has been used to model ZZ50:PCBM, P3HT:PCBM
- Numerous enhancements 
* Bugfix: fixed the memory leak when modeling looking for hopsize



==============
Version 0.6

- read the medium from the BMP files
- reject initial exciton placements, which coincide with the quencher region.
- This software was used to make initial modeling for Zn0-P3HT structures.



==============
Version 0.5

- Quenchers to form crystal clusters
- save a slice of the medium to BMP


==============
Version 0.4

- The code have been split into separate files 
- Round quenchers can be placed homogeneously into the model box
